# Ensemble-Perception-In-Temporal-Crowds
Sina Nakhkoob, Alice Zhang, Cole Johnson, Kyle Pu

Our research experiment is on ensemble perception in temporal crowds with a focus on if ensemble perception functions in scene conditions.

## To Do
- [x] Add variance/outlier
- [x] Adjust the morphing
- [ ] Ignore mouse clicks outside of the grid
- [x] Clicking Input
- [x] Automatic Positioning Based on Picture Size
- [x] Automate all loops (right now it's hard coded for some for loops)
- [x] Take out path names
- [x] For each picture in the scene, morph randomly by first choosing an average and then displaying morphs around it
- [x] Make one of the pictures an outlier and change its variance
